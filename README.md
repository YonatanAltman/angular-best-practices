## Avoid Logic in Templates

If you have any sort of logic in your templates, even if it is a simple && clause, it is good to extract it out into its component.

***Why?***: Having logic in the template means that it is not possible to unit test it, and therefore it is more prone to bugs when changing template code.

**Before**

```html
<p *ngIf="role === 'developer'">Status: Developer</p>
```

```ts
@Input() role?: Role;
```

**After**

```html
<p *ngIf="isDeveloper"></p>
```

```ts
@Input role?: Role;

get isDeveloper(): boolean {
  return this.role === 'developer';
}
```

## Subscribe in Template Using Async Pipe

Avoid subscribing to observables from components and instead subscribe to the observables from the template.

***Why?***: `async` pipe unsubscribe automatically, and it makes the code simpler by eliminating the need to manually manage subscriptions. It also reduces the risk of accidentally forgetting to unsubscribe a subscription in the component, which would cause a memory leak. This risk can also be mitigated by using a lint rule to detect unsubscribed observables.

**Before**

```html
<p>{{ textToDisplay }}</p>
```

```ts
textToDisplay = '';

ngOnInit(): void {
  this.textSubscriotion = this.textService
    .pipe(
      map(value => value.item),
    )
    .subscribe(item => this.textToDisplay = item);
}

ngOnDestroy(): void {
  if (this.textSubscriotion) {
    this.textSubscriotion.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

**After**

```html
<p>{{ textToDisplay$ | async }}</p>
```

```ts
textToDisplay$ = this.textService.pipe(map(value => value.item));
```

## Use trackBy along with ngFor

When using `ngFor` to loop over an array in templates, use it with a `trackBy` function which will return a unique identifier for each item.

***Why?***: When an array changes, Angular re-renders the whole DOM tree. But if you use trackBy, Angular will know which element has changed and will only make DOM changes for that particular element.

**Before**

```html
<li *ngFor="let movie of movies">{{ movie.title }}</li>
```

**After**

```html
<li *ngFor="let movie of movies; trackBy: trackByFn">{{ movie.title }}</li>
```

```ts
trackByFn(index, movie: Movie): string {
  return movie.id;
}
```

## Use Lazy Loading

When possible, try to lazy load the modules in your Angular application. Lazy loading is when you load something only when it is used, for example, loading a component only when it is to be seen.

***Why?***: This will reduce the size of the application to be loaded and can improve the application boot time by not loading the modules that are not used.

**Before**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    pathMatch: 'full',
    component: HomeComponent,
  },
];
```

**After**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    pathMatch: 'full',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/home/home.module').then(m => m.HomeModule),
  },
];
```
