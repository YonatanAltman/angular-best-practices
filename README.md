## Single Responsibility Principle

It is very important not to create more than one component, service, directiveâ€¦ inside a single file. Every file should be responsible for a **single functionality**.

***Why?***: By doing this, we are keeping our files clean, readable, and maintainable.

## Follow Consistent Angular Coding Styles

Here are some set of rules we need to follow to make our project with the proper coding standard.

* Limit files to 400 Lines of code.
* Define small functions and limit them to no more than 75 lines.
* Have consistent names for all symbols. The recommended pattern is `feature.type.ts`.
* If the values of the variables are intact, then declare it with `const`.
* Use `dashes` to separate words in the descriptive name and use `dots` to separate the descriptive name from the type, for example: `movie-list.component.ts`.
* Names of properties and methods should always be in lower camel case. 
* Always leave one empty line between imports and modules, such as third party and application imports and third-party modules and custom modules.

## Keep Up to Date

Angular follows semantic versioning with a new major version released every six months.

Semantic versioning is a convention used for versioning software. It has a `major.minor.patch` format. Angular increments each part when they release `major`, `minor`, or `patch` changes.

You can follow the news about the latest version of Angular from the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and make sure you keep your Angular version up to date, ensuring you always get the latest features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements like Ivy.

It would help if you also used [this official tool](https://update.angular.io) when updating your project from one version to the next.

## Use Angular CLI

[Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) is one of the most powerful accessibility tools available when developing apps with Angular. Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application and follows all the best practices! Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that is used to initialize, develop, scaffold, maintain and even test and debug Angular applications.

So instead of creating the files and folders manually, use Angular CLI to generate new `components`, `directives`, `modules`, `services`, `pipes`, etc.

```shell
# Install Angular CLI
npm i -g @angular/cli

# Check Angular CLI version
ng version
```

## Use State Management

One of the most challenging things in software development is state management. State management in Angular helps in managing state transitions by storing the state of any form of data. In the market, there are several state management libraries for Angular like [NGRX](https://ngrx.io), [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io), [Akita](https://datorama.github.io/akita), etc. and all of them have different usages and purposes.

We can choose suitable state management for our application before we implement it.

Some benefits of using state management.

1. It enables sharing data between different components
1. It provides centralized control for state transition
1. The code will be clean and more readable
1. Makes it easy to debug when something goes wrong
1. Dev tools are available for tracing and debugging state management libraries

## Use Environment Variables

Angular provides environment configurations to declare variables unique for each environment. The default environments are `development` and `production`. We can even add more environments, or add new variables in existing environment files.

Use it when you depend on different values on different environments.

Development environment (the default).

> environment.ts

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  baseApiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
};
```

Production environment.

> environment.prod.ts

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  baseApiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
};
```

## Avoid Logic in Templates

If you have any sort of logic in your templates, even if it is a simple && clause, it is good to extract it out into its component.

***Why?***: Having logic in the template means that it is not possible to unit test it, and therefore it is more prone to bugs when changing template code.

**Before**

```html
<p *ngIf="role === 'developer'">Status: Developer</p>
```

```ts
@Input() role?: Role;
```

**After**

```html
<p *ngIf="isDeveloper"></p>
```

```ts
@Input role?: Role;

get isDeveloper(): boolean {
  return this.role === 'developer';
}
```

## Subscribe in Template Using async Pipe

Avoid subscribing to observables from components and instead subscribe to the observables from the template.

***Why?***: `async` pipe unsubscribe automatically, and it makes the code simpler by eliminating the need to manually manage subscriptions. It also reduces the risk of accidentally forgetting to unsubscribe a subscription in the component, which would cause a memory leak. This risk can also be mitigated by using a lint rule to detect unsubscribed observables.

**Before**

```html
<p>{{ textToDisplay }}</p>
```

```ts
textToDisplay = '';

ngOnInit(): void {
  this.textSubscriotion = this.textService
    .pipe(
      map(value => value.item),
    )
    .subscribe(item => this.textToDisplay = item);
}

ngOnDestroy(): void {
  if (this.textSubscriotion) {
    this.textSubscriotion.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

**After**

```html
<p>{{ textToDisplay$ | async }}</p>
```

```ts
textToDisplay$ = this.textService.pipe(map(value => value.item));
```

## Use Change Detection OnPush

Use the `OnPush` change detection strategy to tell Angular there have been no changes. This lets you skip the entire change detection step.
This change detection works by detecting if some new data has been explicitly pushed into the component, either via a component input or an Observable subscribed to using the async pipe.

***Why?***: The more use of `OnPush` in components we have the fewer checks Angular needs to perform, means better performance.

```html
<app-todo [todo]="todo" *ngFor="let todo of todos"></app-todo>
```

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-todo-list',
  templateUrl: './todo-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./todo-list.component.scss'],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class TodoListComponent {
  @Input() todos;
}
```

## Avoid Having Subscriptions Inside Subscriptions

Sometimes you may want values from more than one observable to perform an action. In this case, avoid subscribing to one observable in to subscribe block of another observable. Instead, use appropriate chaining operators. Chaining operators run on observables from the operator before them. Some chaining operators are: `withLatestFrom`, `combineLatest`, etc.

**Before**

```ts
firstObservable$.pipe(
    take(1)
  )
  .subscribe(firstValue => {
    secondObservable$.pipe(
        take(1)
      )
      .subscribe(secondValue => {
        console.log(`Combined values are: ${firstValue} & ${secondValue}`);
      });
  });
```

**After**

```ts
firstObservable$.pipe(
    withLatestFrom(secondObservable$),
    first()
  )
  .subscribe(([firstValue, secondValue]) => {
      console.log(`Combined values are: ${firstValue} & ${secondValue}`);
  });
```

## Use trackBy Along With ngFor

When using `ngFor` to loop over an array in templates, use it with a `trackBy` function which will return a unique identifier for each item.

***Why?***: When an array changes, Angular re-renders the whole DOM tree. But if you use trackBy, Angular will know which element has changed and will only make DOM changes for that particular element.

**Before**

```html
<li *ngFor="let movie of movies">{{ movie.title }}</li>
```

**After**

```html
<li *ngFor="let movie of movies; trackBy: trackByFn">{{ movie.title }}</li>
```

```ts
trackByFn(index, movie: Movie): string {
  return movie.id;
}
```

## Strings Should Be Safe

If you have a variable of type string that can have only a set of values, instead of declaring it as a string type, you can declare the list of possible values as the type.

***Why?***: By declaring the type of the variable appropriately, we can avoid bugs while writing the code during compile time rather than during runtime.

```ts
export class ButtonComponent {
  @Input() type: string;
}
```

```ts
export class ButtonComponent {
  @Input() type: 'submit' | 'reset' | 'button' = 'button';
}
```

## Avoid any Type

Declare variables or constants with proper types other than any.

***Wny?***: This will reduce unintended problems. Another advantage of having good typings in our application is that it makes refactoring easier.

**Before**

```ts
export class MovieComponent {
  movie: any;
  
  constructor() {
    this.movie = {
      // Whatever we want can be decaler here...
    };
  }
}
```

**After**

```ts
interface Movie {
  title: string;
}

export class MovieComponent {
  movie: Movie;

  constructor() {
    this.movie = {
      title: 'Avengers',
      // We can't decalre other properties...
    };
  }
}
```

## Use Lazy Loading

When possible, try to lazy load the modules in your Angular application. Lazy loading is when you load something only when it is used, for example, loading a component only when it is to be seen.

***Why?***: This will reduce the size of the application to be loaded and can improve the application boot time by not loading the modules that are not used.

**Before**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    pathMatch: 'full',
    component: HomeComponent,
  },
];
```

**After**

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    pathMatch: 'full',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/home/home.module').then(m => m.HomeModule),
  },
];
```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Use index.ts

Instead of remembering multiple source file names, there are some tiny import statements that will fulfill the purpose.

***Why?***: It helps to keep all correlated files in a single location.

**Before**

```ts
import { uuid } from './../utils/uuid';
import { convertToTitleCase } from './../utils/convert-to-title-case';
```

**After**

> utils/index.ts

```ts
export * from './uuid';
export * from './convert-to-title-case';
```

Now we can import all the files from one file.

```ts
import { uuid, convertToTitleCase } from './../utils';
```
